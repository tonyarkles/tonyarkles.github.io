title: Setting up GNSS-SDR
layout: default
---

[GNSS-SDR](http://gnss-sdr.org/) is an open source
GPS/Gallileo/GLONASS software-defined receiver that works with a few
different SDR tuners, including the super cheap
[RTL-SDR](http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr) tuners that you
can pick up for about $20. 

There's a [blog post](http://gnss-sdr.org/node/50) from the GNSS team
that documents the process for getting set up, but I found that it was
a little bit out of date and ran into a few snags. My goal is to
document an "easy" setup for trying this out.

### The equipment

- Cheap RTLSDR compatible device. I use
  [this one](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00D3X9LR4/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). 
- Cheap GPS antenna with LNA. I use
  [this one](http://www.gpscentral.ca/accessories/usglobalsat/antenna-at65.html).
- Homemade Bias Tee (TODO document this)
- Ubuntu 14.04 (might work on other versions, I had trouble on 12.04
  but that might have been my fault)

### Building the software

The GNSS-SDR Build Guide has a lot of steps and third-party packages
that need to be built; my first try, I followed those instructions and
ended up either getting segfaults or having a variety of different
build failures.

Turns out, you can get everything you need from
[Pybombs](http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/pybombs/wiki/QuickStart),
and GNSS-SDR will automatically download any missing pieces and build
them for you. This dramatically reduces the amount of effort required
to set it up.

First, you want to install GNURadio and a few extra packages. Be
warned that this is going to take a while; it might be a good time to
take the dogs for a walk.

<pre><code>
TODO
$ git clone
$ cd 
$ sudo ./pybombs install xxxxx
</code></pre>

After that, you clone the GNSS-SDR repository and build it with
RTL-SDR support.

<pre><code>
TODO
$ git clone
$ cd xxxx
$ export RTLSDR_DRIVER=1
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ make install
</code></pre>

After it's done, there are going to be a few binaries in the
`install/` directory.

### Calibrating your RTL-SDR

For what they cost, the RTL-SDR radios are pretty amazing! $17 for a
radio with a wild bandwidth! For that price, though, you're not getting a
precision instrument; there's drift, frequency offsets, and sample
rate mismatches to deal with. 

GNSS-SDR includes a utility called `front-end-cal` that locks on to a
few GPS satellites and uses them to estimate the slop in the RTL-SDR.
We'll use these correction factors to compensate for the deficiencies
in the radio.

<pre><code>
TODO
$ front-end-cal
</code></pre>

Save that output somewhere. Next, we're going make a copy of the
included RTL-SDR configuration and make a few changes to it.

### Running the receiver

Now we can run the `gnss-sdr` receiver with our custom-rolled
configuration and hopefully start locking onto some satellites!
